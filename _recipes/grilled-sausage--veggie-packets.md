## INGREDIENTS

1 red bell pepper

2 ears corn on the cob

1/2 large yellow (1 medium) onion

4-5 small red potatoes

1 medium sized zucchini

1 package (13 ounces) Butterball Hardwood Smoked Turkey Sausage

5 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon dried oregano

1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon paprika

Seasoned salt and pepper

Optional: freshly chopped parsley

&nbsp;

Prepare the veggies and meat.

Remove top and seeds from the pepper. Thinly slice.

Remove husk from corn and cut into 1 inch disks. Coarsely chop the onion.

Cut the potatoes into small bite-sized pieces -- about 8-10 pieces per potato depending on size.

Coin the zucchini.

Coin the turkey sausage.

Assemble

Preheat the grill to medium heat.

In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, paprika, about 1/2 teaspoon (or to taste) seasoned salt and pepper. Stir.

Add seasonings to the veggies + meat and toss well.

Place 2 pieces of tin foil on top of each other.

Put a generous amount of the mixture in the center and then fold up the first piece of foil and then the next piece of foil to form a secure encasing.

Grill covered over medium heat for 16-24 minutes (depending on heat of grill) until veggies are crisp tender.

Remove and top with freshly chopped parsley if desired.
